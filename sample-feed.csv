The Road Glide Special’s frame-mounted shark nose fairing cuts through wind for long-haul stability, while the custom touches like the ape hangers and exhaust turn this bagger into a one-of-a-kind statement.

Those features include:
A seat height of 25.6 inches allows more riders to place both feet flat on the ground when the motorcycle is stopped, and a new low-profile seat reduces the reach to the foot controls. Premium lowered front and rear suspension lowers the bike’s center of gravity and makes it easier to lift the motorcycle off its jiffy stand, yet delivers outstanding comfort and handling.The overall width of the primary drive housing and derby cover are reduced to further improve leg clearance to the ground.A pull-back handlebar places hand controls two inches closer to the rider, putting many riders in a more comfortable position that can reduce back and shoulder strain.Smaller-diameter hand grips reduce the finger reach to the brake and clutch levers.Assist and Slip (A&S) hydraulic clutch reduces lever effort 23 percent, a key benefit in stop- and-go traffic.A new passenger footboard mount allows the footboards to be folded up so they are out of the way when pushing the motorcycle in a garage or driveway.A new toe tab extension reduces the reach required to retract the jiffy stand.
Visually indistinguishable from standard Harley-Davidson Touring models, the Ultra Classic Low is equipped with the full complement of Project RUSHMORE features that set the standard for long-haul touring comfort and convenience. The High Output Twin Cam 103 engine provides abundant power for touring two-up and confident passing. A wind tunnel-tested Batwing fairing with Splitstream vent limits head buffeting.
